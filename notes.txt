I realized it would probably be better to actually keep those notes digitally, so I am 

going to dump here everything I wrote down so far.

"Everything is hexagon." -- Boss


[1 Player mode] (1P)

2 different gameplay modes: "strat" and "hero"
	-strat: STR-like (can only be paused in 1P)
	-hero: lvl system? if yes, xp curve is slow ( ___/ instead of /----- ). lvl cap?

1 bloc ~= 66 cm (height) ?
width is 1 m
	smaller blocs?
		ratio? 2:1 or 3:1? (2:1 seems more appropriate)
		placing? (maybe overlap)

Player model:
	blocky or not?
	customizable?
		how much? (texture? model?)

NPCs: AI! (basically the 2nd most important of the game)
	-general AI stored on server (animals too)
	-evolves according to players' games
		-> client AI updated weekly? monthly?

no scripted AI; all self-learning
	(should I use this for my thesis?)

Grid:
full hexagonal (duh)
possibility to have hollow blocks (walls = 10 cm wide?)

Bloc editor
	free to DL?

mod editor?


Multiplayer

only 1 strat player
	except if there are more than 1 factions

	(factions are kinda like teams in AoE)

hero players can be neutrals (not faction-bound)
	-mercenaries?

weapon/armor crafting?

more on Strat:
	no direct control over NPCs?
		special mod for that?

remote camera over NPCs and allied heroes

ages? probably not
	definitely gonna make some kind of technology tree
		probably not a tree per se though



PCG
everything is gonna be generated at the map's creation

from rivers to montains to lakes/seas/water/BIG BODIES OF WATER OKAY

Cliffs have to be a thing
